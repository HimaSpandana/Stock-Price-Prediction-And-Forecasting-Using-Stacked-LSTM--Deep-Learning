# Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM--Deep-Learning



Discover Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Python and how you can use them to make stock market predictions! The stock which im working is AAPL. Apple Computer, Inc.

Steps that I performed in the projet are

1.Collect the stock data- AAPL and do data investigation

2.Preprocess the data - Train and Test the data

3.Create an stacked LSTM model

4.Predict and plot the output of the test data

5.Predict the future for the next 30 days and plot the output

Im using pandas-datareader which is Up-to-date remote data access for pandas. Works for multiple versions of pandas.

we can extract data from various Internet sources into a pandas DataFrame. In this project im using Tingo

Tingo: Tiingo is a tracing platform that provides a data api with historical end-of-day prices on equities, mutual funds and ETFs.

• The objective of this project is to forecast the next 30 days share values of a company by using previous share values dataset.

• The stock data is collected from pandas data reader library

• Data visualization is done to get insights from the data

• MinMaxScaler is used to transform the features into the scale 0 and 1

• Further applying stacked LSTM to train the model.
